A powerful advanced graphing calculator. With the ability to derive, integrate, evaluate expressions, and eventually 3D graphing. Built on the Granite framework for elementary os.

An open source mathematical tool that will put powerful computing power behind an elegant, easy to use, simple interface for everyone. It also approaches mathematical problems in a new way by wrapping mathematical concepts in code from the ground up, I call this approach, Natural Math Processing or simply NMP. Its goal is to be able to solve mathematical problems and show steps in a way that a human would. Want to know more? click on the wiki below! There is a really cool diagram at the second page too, you should check it out :)
